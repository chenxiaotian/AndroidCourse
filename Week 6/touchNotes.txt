MotionEvent: represents a movement

contains
--Action Code (what type of action)
--ACtion Values (info about time, source, location, etc)

Multitouch: emit one movement trace per touch source
--each touch source is called  "pointer"
--each pointer has a unique ID for as long as it is active
--MotionEvents can refer to multiple pointer
--each pointer has an index within the event (differnet from the unique ID)

some MotionEvent actions
--ACTION_DOWN
--ACTION_POINTER_DOWN (another finger has started to touch the finger)
--ACTION_POINTER_UP (one of the fingers has stopped touch)
--ACTION_MOVE
--ACTION_UP
--ACTION_CANCEL (something has prematurely canceled the gesture)


MotionEvents methods
--getActionMasked(): returns the action code
--getActionIndex(): returns the index of the pointer (e.g. find the index of ACTION_POINTER_DOWN)
--getPointerId(int pointerIndex)
--getPointercount(): returns # of pointers
--getX(int pointerIndex)
--getY(int pointerIndex)
--findPointerIndex()

View.onTouchListener defines touch event callback methods
View.setOnTouchListener
onTouch() called when a touch event oocrus, called before the vent is develiered
--return T if it consumes the event, false if not


GestureDetector: can recognize common gestures
--Activity need a GestureDetector class, give an object that implements GestureDetector.OnGestureListener interface
--activity will receive ontouchEvent when activity is touched
--
